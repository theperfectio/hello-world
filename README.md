Creating first repository with GitHub
My name is Debra Simpson. Although I heard of GitHub, this is my first time using it. Looks like a text editor that I am using with comment features that uses hashtags or pound sign is what us old folks call it. The only change that I made to this branch is doing an introduction like the instructions say.
